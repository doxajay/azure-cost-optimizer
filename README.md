Azure Policy Guardrails with Terraform
This project automates security governance by deploying Azure Policies using Terraform to block public IP exposure at the resource-group level. 
It enforces least-privilege and secure-by-default cloud compliance — ideal for standardized client onboarding and Zero-Trust environments.
In bullet points:
  Deploy Azure Policy + Scoped Assignment via IaC
  Prevent Public IP creation (Zero Trust enforcement)
  Supports standardized client onboarding
  Eliminates manual misconfiguration risk
